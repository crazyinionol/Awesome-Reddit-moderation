The same cycle we've seen time and time again where there is a period of lack of content to discuss so memes go on the rise, then as changes and info trickle down, it gets hit with the pent up analysis that everyone has bottled for a few weeks and it is often very overtly-hyper critical.\n\nWhat has also changed lately is the influx of new subs (Us hitting 100k recently and the influx of reddit bots) has started to affect a few things.\n\nI always akin a good niche subreddit as a niche bar that gets suddenly too popular and the owners are scrambling to meet the new majority's wants.\n\nStarting out the bar is exclusive and many regulars frequent it because it has an atmosphere and discussion and theme that is right for that small niche audience. As it grows, the conversations start changing. As more casual and average people come to the bar looking for simple bar food as opposed to experiencing the new chefs exciting dish or the newly imported stout, the owners are forced to grow with them instead unless they sacrifice a lot. Youre not seeing the same regular people, but influx of new faces every day. But since they are casual they arnt looking for the same things the regular do and this causes friction.\n\nWe've tried to keep that balance. We're upping the removal and banning of threatening comments and trying to excise some of the most malignant users. But we're also reaching a point where many conversations are not threatening or harassing or insulting but instead merely being reported because someone staunchly disagrees or is embedded in their camp of thought and refuses to give up.\n\nSo when I see something like, \"Mods Fix This\" is that the people giving me the power to exercise my ability to ban to kick extreme views?\n\nWould I be allowed to ban the guy who says this game is absolute shit and demanding GGG to make an auction house while ignoring all the conversations and discussions about why that is bad? He isnt breaking any rules, he isnt flaming other people, he is merely expressing his views. Extreme as they maybe.\n\nWould I be allowed to ban the guy who goes out of his way to defend GGG's actions in every single post by saying GGG knows what they are doing, just trust them?\n\nThis is the danger that we are trying to figure out and balance with every action and comment we see. I know I personally am asking, am I policing the person here, or am I policing his content. Some content might be inflammatory simply because of the nature of the discussion but he isnt directing it at people, hes simply stating his views and then defending it poorly.\n\nI dunno, just some thoughts.

We wouldnt have made a megathread for Crimson Dance until we've seen the 3 to 4 memes of it but for this sub, it pretty much stops there and stops being upvoted. The browsers of new queue are pretty good at that. They report duplicates a lot and we remove them.\n\nAlso, the thread Bex posted for Crimson Dance is sorta already the megathread for Crimson Dance.\n\nYou cant really circle jerk if it takes 5 upvotes to bring it to the front page and its not like we have 12 people submitting crimson dance threads + the meme threads. Additionally theres just really no other content to be had. (Go take a look at new and it'll become immediately apparent why 4 iterations of this meme made it to the front at all.)\n\nLastly, we have a dev tracker in discord and we have GGG flairing. What is common issues and what are common suggestions because in this game whatever point of knowledge you have, the next knowledge bit you need to learn would fall under that common issues/common suggestions.\n\nFor example, if you never played a cyclone build before and start one, youll suddenly hit a shit load of obvious common suggestions about keeping your cyclones short so you dont lose dps. But if you never play a cyclone build, that suggestion literally is meaningless to you and you would never seek it out.\n\nThe nature of this game molds the sub A LOT more then people would give credit for. How knowledge is acquired in this game is a need basis built on the build youre playing and you end up in situations where some one can be a literal ZiggyD informed god one build and a complete absolute noob on another.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1501083916,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dkqz4ul","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_6pkl61","parent_id":"t1_dkqwgox","retrieved_on":1501861570,"score":1,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m"}

{"author":"darkenspirit","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"So (and this ties into why the recent top scam thread was removed)\n\nits a matter of tone and intent. A front page post that encourages people to scam even sarcastically and satirically is much different in tone from someone explaining how people scam and how to avoid it.\n\nEven though the content may end up the same, basically both being how to's, the tone matters a lot. A lot of players who do visit and frequent this sub, already know majority of the scam methods and are already far better at identifying them than most players. Additionally above all else, theres only really 1 golden rule to avoid being scammed. The negative tone with encouragement to scam leads to players thinking its okay to scam. Which is a much different mentality than, I dont want to be scammed. \n\nI was the one who should have removed that post before it got more upvotes and reached the front page and after thinking about it more, the mod who did remove it was correct. It was negative in tone and more likely to cause scamming, than preventing scamming.\n\nAlso there is really only 1 golden rule to avoid being scammed.\n\n**Just check the item before hitting accept**. No matter what trade method, disconnecting, pretending to have full inventory, replacing 6L with 6S, everything involving the trade window comes back to this. Mouse over and read your items. You have all the time in the world before clicking it. Use it. Everything else not involving the trade window are just blind leaps of faith and trust with other players, there isnt a guide or advice in how to make that better. \n\nThat being said, there shouldnt need to be how to avoid scamming vids showing specific scam methods in any context. Because the rule is, look at the item and is it what you want to accept? The moment the video/text/whatever goes into a specific method, now its teaching how to scam. That is the difference and why we shouldnt have a \"Encyclopedia of scam methods.\"\n\nThis isnt like D2 where you can turn on PVP and pop someone of all their gear and steal it pretending you can turn it all into SOJs. Save some serious abusable trade bugs, there isnt really a need for scam methods. Just the golden rule.

Without it, this sub becomes either dead or just memes. Though there is lots of arguments about the quality of the other content, this has merit. We have mods who went through periods of this sub where item showcases were banned and the sub was a ghosttown (already look at our new and look at the content that gets to the front page), there isnt a lot of content to fill the gaps.\n\n2nd problem is that we are only allowed 2 stickies. The two current stickies are pretty important. We could include showcase into the price check... but that kinda dilutes that function. \n\nEven with the two stickies, these threads get missed so the idea of making a multisticky thread where people have to go inside to find links to the other megathreads for specific topics seemed like a lot of work for little to no merit.\n\nEnforcing the flair has been difficult but it isnt impossible.\n\nIf you want to filter them, please report them as flair.

But thats also because we're well into this league where the content has been discussed and all thats left of poe now is item goals and likewise the subreddit reflects that. This is the cycle of this game.\n\nWe have great discussion at content release. It gets consumed, discussed and mastered within a month and whats left to explore that takes the longest time to explore and achieve is item crafting and build optimization. So naturally thats all thats left for the sub.\n\nI am open to discussion but largely I have been unimpressed with the engagement at this time of the league consistently for the past 4 leagues now.

This isnt supposed to be a soapbox so you can shout at GGG. This is for the game.

(This has no effect elsewhere on the site).\n\n&gt;They can add other users as moderators.\n\nAs you can see, we already do a lot more than that purely on volunteer efforts and hopes to see the community get what it wants. So my opinion or answers or \"pre-thinked\" thoughts are largely irrelevant because it isnt a dictatorship. I present what I think are the problems and we have a discussion about it.\n\nIf you have questions you think the community should ask GGG.... why dont you make a thread about it? Why do I have to scour the subreddit for content to push forth to GGG as an intermediary? I am not your champion to speak with GGG. You dont need that. They have official feedback forums where that kind of relationship is implied, you can email them directly, you can PM and have private conversations with them yourself. If you feel its a community issue, submit a thread and get the community. Our job is to make sure it doesnt devolve into a shouting match of insults and stays on topic.\n","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1530028095,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":1530028441,"gilded":0,"id":"e1bp7qa","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_8u0eub","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_e1boq70","permalink":"\/r\/pathofexile\/comments\/8u0eub\/poe_reddit_has_become_loot_images\/e1bp7qa\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1532952819,"rte_mode":"markdown","score":18,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m","subreddit_type":"public"}

Subreddit is not the proper channel to give feedback or bug reports to GGG. That was the only purpose of your thread. \n\nIn this instance, raising awareness that logging in could let you gain access to another person's account is probably the worst thing you can do if you did nothing to report it to GGG to handle first.\n\nSubreddit is about discussion and threads that promote discussions. Theres nothing to discuss here. Theres a bug on the servers that leads to people gaining access to other accounts. Report it, move on, what is there to tell people about? That they should try to spin the dice and see if they can login as someone else?\n\nTake it from the perspective of GGG, if there was a login issue, would you want tons of people learning about it and then subsequently checking to see if they can login as someone else or check to see if their account was cleaned out? Either way both could lead to logging in as someone else even if your intention was to login to see if there was any issues.\n\nedit-- you guys missed the point.\n\nThe question wasnt \"Why are we not allowed to talk about the bug.\" The question was \"why was this thread specifically removed.\" And the reasons were as stated as above.\n\nIf we were GGG white knighting and censoring, you'd think we would have removed the much older thread that's literally on the front page with far more comments about the bug that actually went out to report the issue and not break rule 10?\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pathofexile\/comments\/a0h2my\/uhh_i_just_logged_out_to_character_screen_and_was\/","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":1,"created_utc":1543235999,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":1543253250,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"eahyeil","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_a0h2my","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eahvqsb","permalink":"\/r\/pathofexile\/comments\/a0h2my\/uhh_i_just_logged_out_to_character_screen_and_was\/eahyeil\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1546062158,"score":-30,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/pathofexile","subreddit_type":"public"}

The amount of lurkers to actual upvotes to downvotes is something like 94-97% lurkers where only 3-6% of the subscribed users on this sub actually participate in upvotes\/downvotes and even less in commenting.\n\nIn a sub this large, it means very small # of people control majority of the content and how the new queue looks. This coupled with the monetary incentive of bots and RMT, there is a strong case bots are used to manipulate votes.\n\nAll these things are largely outside of the mods powers as we can only really identify people by their posts. We cannot ban for voting for instances and theres no track of that for us to see. We can report it to admins but we never know the conclusion of our reports as all admin reports return back with very vague messaging about how \"Possibly\" something was done in response to our inquiry. So we never really know if what we're doing is actually correct or yielding results until 3-4 months later.\n\nWhat I am basically saying is, we need more participation. If even 1 out of every 10 people who reads a thread begins participating with upvotes and downvotes, the way our front page and new could change dramatically.

I said nothing about plagiarizing. I didnt imply it nor accuse anyone of it. I said the thread borders on doxxing and witch hunting. \n\n2. I said the thread is presented in a way that begs the question with a conclusion. The thread is titled, GGG is protecting someone where the real beef and body of the title is about an artist tracing \/ plagiarizing. I dont care about the merits of the photo contest, mods are not GGG and we have nothing to do with judging the art contest so we are not making judgments about tracing, plagiarizing, what have you. That is not what my message is about. My message was about how this thread in the way it is presented and the way the OP continues to conduct himself in the comments are potentially rule breaking. Please read that carefully. I said potentially. I havent RULED anything yet, otherwise this thread would be locked\/removed or had an actual mod action.\n\n3. Witch hunting is it's own criterion. There are ways to present evidence without inciting people to do go out and do something. The fact that the thread is about a potential GGG conspiracy to protect cheaters and then he goes into a broader view about how the culture of GGG is about protecting cheaters is far from the original point he was trying to make. He is using this scenario for more than what it is and that is why it \"borders\" on doxxing and witch hunting and is why I said I will be monitoring it. That is why the thread is \"suspect\" because now he is showing multiple agendas. Is he here to show off the work of other redditors in sluething a potential art contest problem? Or has he spent many moments doxxing this artist, hunting down scans, and then publically making them a social media spectacle when he could have just gathered all that evidence and sent it to GGG and waited for official reply before taking more action? Or maybe his continued assertion that GGG has a culture of protecting cheaters is another motive to the thread entirely?\nSimply put, I dont know but it doesnt look like its in honest faith because regular procedure on this does not involve creating a thread and making it about GGG's cheater protecting culture. It should have begun at the most with a thread saying, he this artists stuff looks uncredited and is this allowed?

We talked about and thought maybe we were a bit lax on the trade posts.\n\nBut after that discussion we also agreed its possible it was just the vocal minority voicing their hatred for trade posts. Hence why the wording was hey we planned on doing this but we want your thoughts.\n\nThats usually how our discussions go, we address a complaint action with discussion, formulate a plan to address it then present that plan to the sub.\n\nDoing it the other way where we just go, oh theres a problem, what do you think we should do about it..... wont lead to a consensus. It just wont. The comments become just terribly polarizing. Better we present plans on what to do to address the issue and see if people want it that way or not. if not we go back to the drawing board or if the poll reveals its split, we continue the way we were because again.. no strong feelings either way.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m","parent_id":"t1_dfwsggo","author":"darkenspirit"}

Out of 250 posts, only barely 20 posts got past 3 upvotes. 250 posts is almost an entire day of posting. Removing those on the basis of OP's criteria means you have a front page full of questions and 0 upvoted stuff. If you filtered with RES all the tags you dont want except discussion, youre gonna have find week old content.\n\nHonestly out of that what would have been front page worthy during a time when there are no new content to talk about, no new patches to talk about, the league is figured out, and people complaining about the items that people are showing off? As much as you want people to discuss new builds or try new things, majority of people simply ARNT interested. The PoE forums prove that to a T. New builds with exciting mechanics or possibly weird interactions or experimentation, are ignored. They get like 2 or 3 comments, the build maker tries it, finds out it isnt as good as HOWAs clear speed and moves on having enjoyed the time he spent. The builds that are found to be as good as HOWA are far and few in between and do make it to the front page already.\n\nAs far as your hotmail analogy goes, you wouldnt have spam if you hadnt only subscribed to spam. Go to new and tell me we arnt just dying for mechanics changing so we can actually have discussion while in the meantime everyone twiddles their thumbs with memes.\n\nWhat discussion is to be had there? Look at the posts in new, what discussions could arise from someone asking about their specific build goal? We have a lot of those questions in the discord and even then the discussion is almost always, well this can do better you can switch to that and its always between 2 people with 1 or 2 chiming in occasionally.\n\nIf discord doesnt have the rich discussion, what discussion would reddit have during non patch content times? I dont disagree there is good content when there is actual content. But the reality is all the real content that deserves to be on the front page that actually gets people to discussion already do make it to the front page. All the ask dev threads made it ot the front, all the trade discussions made it to the front, all the sub recommendations made it to the front, all the BEST ideas of suggestions make it to the front page. The game changing stuff like new way to color items through vorici jewelers, made it to the front. Discussion about economics and market make it to the front.\n\nWhat else is there besides patch content?\n\nArguably even during new content the only difference separating good discussion from the current complained about content posts is that no one has ever seen it before. If thats the criteria then all the new players deserve a chance to see things vets have seen ad infinitum so we cant keep removing them or else we alienate new people.\n\nTell me how do I stay moderate in this situation without blasting one group for another?","score":2,"author_flair_css_class":"asc-assassin","edited":1491493203,"subreddit":"pathofexile","controversiality":0,"can_gild":true,"created_utc":1491492613,"id":"dfwuo3j","author_flair_text":"Assassin","distinguished":"moderator","link_id":"t3_63sjbm","stickied":false,"retrieved_on":1493847409,"gilded":0}

People are burnt out because this league is exceptionally long and the recent players are not used to this cycle because they have been spoiled by the last 6-7 leagues.\n\n&gt;Past leagues\n\n&gt;The Breach leagues ran from December 2, 2016 to February 27, 2017.\n\n&gt;The Essence leagues ran from September 2, 2016 to November 28, 2016.\n\n&gt;The Prophecy leagues ran from June 3, 2016 to August 29, 2016.\n\n&gt;The Perandus leagues ran from March 4, 2016 to May 30, 2016.\n\n&gt;The Talisman leagues ran from December 11, 2015 to March 4, 2016.\n\n&gt;The Warbands league and Tempest league ran from July 10, 2015 to October 2, 2015.\n\n&gt;The Torment league and Bloodlines league ran from December 12, 2014 to March 24, 2015.\n\n&gt;The Rampage league and Beyond league ran from August 20, 2014 to November 20, 2014.\n\n&gt;The Ambush league and Invasion league ran from March 5, 2014 to July 5, 2014.\n\n&gt;The Domination league and Nemesis league ran from October 23, 2013 to February 23, 2014.\n\n&gt;The Anarchy league and Onslaught league ran from June 8, 2013 to October 8, 2013.\n\nLook at those starting dates (See how soon new content has been coming out right as leagues end compared to 3.0 and more recent leagues? 3 days vs &gt;weeks) and then compare to this chart of our [subs activity.](http://imgur.com/QSc9gum) Of course when people get bored, they start complaining. Once beta hits, expect this sub to explode in activity.\n\nYou'll see while we are CONSTANTLY growing (First link), we get HUGE spikes of growth during content release or new leagues. It is that spike in subs that fuels a lot of our discussions because the experts and vets of this game dont really discuss here during off season because they know changes are coming or you know, realized the meta is figured out and is now waiting for a fresh one. Any discussion there is really pointless when manifestos have hit saying everything they know about PoE right now will change. Theres no point to speculate in Reddit when Discord is a much better medium for it.\n\nYou should check out our discord, it is constantly filled with \"vets\" talking about this game who do not feel \"abandoned\" at all. Way to generalize.","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1496144659,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":1496144911,"gilded":0,"id":"di80b2m","link_id":"t3_6e6ndy","parent_id":"t3_6e6ndy","retrieved_on":1496939925,"score":1,"stickied":true,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m"}

I moderate the discord as well and participate and 90% of the conversation that fills our discord (a much better medium for discussion compared to reddit) is almost all exclusively build and item related questions / topics while the rest is all mundane chatter where one person says oh look what I sold for 10c (Which gets posted here), or look what I just crafted (which is what is also posted here). (Occasionally a market question but we have those covered which made it to the front page as well such as 100c for an exalt). No one on this sub seems to want to discuss a topic such as \"What do you think of this build?\" Because theres nothing to talk about. Can it do shaper? Yes, can it not? What can it do? The minutia and granular discussion isnt good on reddit and too long to keep the attention of everyone who posts here. Everything that happens in the best medium for discussion already happens on this subreddit but in a shittier form of Q&amp;A style responses rather than discords back and forth.\n\nThe ebb and flow of content on this subreddit is predictable. When theres a new patch with content or changes, discussion is lively about mechanics and tons of suggestion type posts that lead to a lot of discussion about fairness of items, balance of builds, the meta, and skill interaction.\n\nOnce those patch notes hit and reality is cemented, all those discussions end. Theres nothing more to discuss except ragging on GGG for doing it \"wrong\" or \"ruining\" the game. \n\nThe heart of discussion in this game boils down to items, builds and how to make currency. Goals are set by individuals for themselves and the only discussion that can consistently arise is questions about interaction and those 3 topics which are majority, question form where 3-4 people respond and the matter is resolved. The only discussion i see that occur here is when someone or everyone is wrong about a mechanic and they have a back and forth about how they think it works.\n\nYou see complaints in this thread about the new queue being mostly about questions. What else is there? You cant keep discussing the same QoL Suggestions that get suggested every patch ad infinitum.\n\nFlair system needs work, I agree. But I think at the end of the day when the flair is 100% working and you filter out your fluff and memes, you are left with the same 3 discussion posts that last no longer than 30 mins.\n\nTake a look at our new and let me know which ones will fill the void? Look at how big the void would be without everything else and explain what is supposed to fill it that isnt just rehashed topics over and over. Because at the end of the day, I argue the meme threads provoke different discussion the same [level as regular discussion threads.](https://i.imgur.com/lT2rCbc.png)\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m"}

{"body":"All those things you listed are still on the front page or in the sidebar now. We dont need another post for Ziggy's intro vids that are gravely out of date, or in fact anyone's intro videos. Leveling fast guides appeared when there were racing, there isnt racing now and with the new 3.0 content, i bet there will be TONS OF NEW posts soon that will have guides and discussions about how to level fast.\n\nIm getting back to my original point. All those topics you pointed out only appear when theres new content. But after the first 2 weeks of a league or said new content, its figured out and everything else gets regulated to question posts. When we had the question sticky all those topics you posted went into that sticky after the first week because it was established and no one was discussing them anymore.\n\nYoure telling me you as a person who has played this game multiple times over want to discuss the same topics over and over? New topics are hitting the front page, its not hard, it takes 15 upvotes to make it there. We have a new guide on how to off color bases which is huge because there hasnt been anything MECHANICALLY Different about the core game for a very long time.\n\nOf course all those topics were awesome discussions during that time, they were new for everyone. Now all thats new is how to abuse leaguestones because everything else has been discussed to death.\n\nSo I ask you again, when new content gets figured out after the first two weeks, save the random breakthrough post like recoloring using socket voricis, what else is there to discuss? The lions share gets discussed when new content is put out and patch notes released. After 2 weeks people actually stop playing the game, why would they keep discussing the game? This is the trend we are seeing and this is the trend we've seen multiple times play out in this sub over the years. When 3.0 hits, youll have the subreddit you want but after 3 weeks, it will once again be dead.\n\nTake a look at new. Really dive into, deep into 200 posts. Find me the 30 that you think would have made front page discussion worthy that wasnt already discussed to death. Visit the discord and youll find even discussions die in there because its discussed to death. Theres nothing to discuss. If your goal is X, then Y is the best for it in min maxing.

What you don't see when you made this point is a subreddit full of nothing but meme posts and \"this dropped for me in Tidal Island\" and \"look at my Ventor's\" etc. posts. You don't see a subreddit full of low content posts because hundreds of these are deleted every week.\n\nSometimes a few slip by. The vast majority of the time they slip by, they languish in purgatory with no upvotes and only inappropriate comments and eventually are reported enough or cleaned up (mods aren't on 24/7). Every once in awhile, one is actually funny and original enough that the community upvotes it and it comes through to the front page, and we'll let it stick around - but this is very, very rare.\n\nAdditionally, we have an auto moderator. When a post or comment is reported by active users of the subreddit enough times, we get a warning to investigate a post or comment. If the post continues to get enough reports before *or after* we approve it, at some point the post will get automatically removed.\n\nIn the case of your `2.3 Meta Confirmed` post, it was removed by the AutoModerator because *players kept reporting it over and over again.* And at that point, a mod looked at it and agreed it would continue to get negative reports and let it stay deleted.\n\nHope that helps explain things.

We know specifically that the Phenxx moderator account was compromised. No other mod account was obviously compromised, though of course this is possible. The Phenxx account was the one used to deface the subreddit. In fact, the modqueue is interesting because the compromised account made changes which were revoked by GoogaNautGod when he noticed them, unfortunately this prompted the attacker to remove all of the mods he could before continuing. [This is seen in the moderation log here](http://i.imgur.com/NZK35a3.png).\n\n2. The active mods were aware that the Phenxx account was mostly idle and had discussed whether or not to try to have it removed, however Reddit has a strange mod hierarchy designed to prevent new mods from hijacking a subreddit, such that a moderator can only remove other moderators who became mods *after* them, not *before* them. Thus, we could not remove the Phenxx account, but unfortunately that account could remove all of the active mods.\n\n3. Luckily, #2 worked to our benefit when one of the two higher ranked mods (slowmyrole19) responded to the attack by removing Phenxx as a moderator and re-inviting all of the active moderators (incidentally resetting everyone's moderator age to 0). We had contacted Reddit admins about it but they were not fast to respond (as far as I know they have not responded yet, but I could be wrong).\n\nIt's important to note that Phenxx's (I believe pohx's reddit account, but could be wrong) *account credentials* were compromised, possibly related to the pohx compromise. Nothing on the subreddit or reddit in general was actively hacked.","gilded":0,"created_utc":1467146208,"ups":8,"parent_id":"t3_4qbc4q","author":"trackpete"}

Some mods (like me!) are harsh and cruel and regularly delete hundreds of posts a week that violate the subreddit rules (usually repetitive or boring), others are a bit more careful and only go after newer posts, and all of us spend a lot of time looking at reported comments and threads. We're also all volunteers, so there's plenty of times when the sub goes unmoderated for a few hours here and there (especially on weekends where we've sorta declared an unofficial truce).\n\nThe only way to have a consistent system would be if like every moderator had to discuss and agree on every action, and, well, no, that's not plausible.\n\nBased on our moderator discussions, general guidelines, etc., I will attempt to answer your questions from my specific way of moderating:\n\n&gt; What counts as a meme post?\n\nI don't really care about \"meme\" posts per say, but I'm strict on \"low effort content.\" This generally includes anything that is just a screenshot if it's not unique (i.e. if I've seen a similar screenshot posted 50x before, I delete it). I also remove a lot of twitch clips that are obviously terrible and boring (\"streamerX drops a mirror\") and short duration. I've probably removed hundreds of various Streamer RNG related posts in the time I've been a mod.\n\nOTOH, I personally don't have any interest in watching every stupid clip in new. So, if it gets reported, I might look and make a decision based on the report (helps if there's something useful in the report, not just \"spam\")...  but generally I'm not going to watch every clip in new to see if it's OC. I'll let the boats decide.\n\n&gt; versus questions where the community is seeking answers from GGG?\n\nI remove @GGG posts are removed if they're hostile or repetitive with prejudice. Same thing if it's just something pulled out into a new thread from another thread (i.e. \"@ggg you said in thread X this thing and I don't like it\"). Reply in the discussion.\n\nIf it's clearly a general question aimed at GGG, it might also be removed for being low effort, unoriginal, not relevant to most of the playerbase, etc., depends on the specific situation. Generally, this sub shouldn't be considered a special way to get in contact with GGG. E-mail 'em or something.\n\nYou can see we leave a lot of posts like \"does anyone else\" and things like that, which are discussions aimed *at GGG* but the discussion itself is pointed at the community. Those are great. If a post doesn't really involved the community but is just aimed at GGG, that's boring.\n\nAlso, sometimes a perfectly nice OP will get removed because the OP started a flamewar of doom.\n\nAnd like any human based system, sometimes there's confusion, or a mod reads a post too fast and doesn't understand, or an OP doesn't really do a good job that makes it clear they aren't Just Another Post About Shadows, etc. It happens. Don't take it personally, just wait a few days and try a different take or go to pathofexile.com or message the moderators about it and be chill.\n\nHope that helps - this isn't the exact stance of every mod, but I think it reflects our general attitudes.\n\nedit - FWIW, the [post you're complaining about](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/5nc6wq/why_does_using_blood_magic_on_a_skill_affect/) looks a lot like a general question to me. I think you were trying to draw attention to the situation, not actually ask for opinions on why it worked that way, but it's clearly phrased as a mechanics question that should be in the questions thread. If you had posted it as a \"this issue needs attention because it's broken or doesn't make sense\" kind of post, it wouldn't have been removed as a question post.

We are well aware that there is a huge range of opinions on the questions thread between the two extremes, and have and are actively discussing ways to provide a similar experience for those who just want to post simple questions but don't want to drop into [the Discord channels](https://discord.gg/0ybQUsRoo91vwONn) for it.\n\nThe changes to the sub have been in place for a very short period of time. We're already receiving valuable feedback (like this) on those changes, which is a *critical part of why the changes were made.* You can debate theory all you want, but if you change something and measure the result, you've got some justification in the future.\n\n----------\nTo respond and clarify a few of your misconception points, however:\n\n\n&gt; 1) Questions never get answered.\n\nFor the record, no mod ever thought that. We all loved the questions thread. We didn't love getting complaints every day from people who thought it was stupid.\n\n&gt; 2) Redditors would prefer to not use the stickied Questions thread.\n\nThere was a significant amount of feedback from redditors in prior discussion threads that indicated the sticky thread was confusing, forgotten about, or that people didn't bother to check it. There was a recurring theme of \"I didn't know there was a questions thread\" in responses to moderation of questions. The general extreme of feedback was \"get rid of the sticky and let everyone just post questions.\"\n\nThis feedback was the basis for the proposed rules and survey questions. You're correct, there wasn't an \"either / or\" question. In the feedback flamewar that had been happening up to that point, defense of the questions thread was low.\n\n&gt; 3) The Stickied Questions Thread, in addition to the Price Check Thread, clogs up the subreddit.\n\nIt's not that it \"clogs up\" the sub. Having both of our announcement slots used up 24/7 prevents us from using those announcement slots for other engagement activities. We've already used this slot multiple times for community stuff since freeing it up. Having that extra slot gives us even more options to use it in the future.\n\n--------\n\n**tl;dr:** Mods got lots of negative feedback about people not wanting to participate in a questions sticky, with few people defending it. Mods got lots of feedback that we should allow questions in general posts instead. Mods asked to be sure that people would really be ok with a bunch of questions in /new, because that seemed crazy to us. People said it was cool. Mods took all of that feedback and got rid of the questions thread. Mods sat back to see how the sub would respond. People started defending the questions thread that previously had been hated on.

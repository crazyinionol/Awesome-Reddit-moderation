{"body":"Here is how it played out from my POV:\n\n2 of our mods stepped down for various reasons, in part related to a new rule implemented which was not received well and not discussed with the users here (which was our mistake)\n\nA thread is made where you nominate various people, a bunch of nominations all fine. I don't have time to go through all of them, their post history etc, and the next day I wake up I see a bunch of people are invited to be moderators by another mod. I have the feeling it's a bit hasty move, but I guess fine - we can still de-mod them if they don't turn out to be good moderators (again lack of communication from our side both to you guys, and to each other). But still not a big mistake in my eyes, time will tell how the new people fit in.\n\nI post a (mod mail) wall of text on how we moderate shit, ask everyone to be transparent in what they do, no big changes without discussing internally first, etc.\n\nIn spite of this there are some changes, and I agree with OP that there should've been at least a week of no changes, to let the situation settle down, but it's not the end of the world. You don't like the change say so, and it can be changed back (Yes, I know we should ask you first, and that is what we intend to do in the future, this was a mistake).\n\nSame thing with people who were nominated but were not invited. If someone is truly interested and has the community back them up - for all that is holy send us a mail and we will work it out. The way I see it, more competent people on the mod list less work I have to do.\n\nTo touch on the issue of people not posting here, I don't either but I read almost everything. I check on here at least 3 times a day, except for some weekends, I usually idle all day in IRC, and check there too a few times a day. I have a job, I go to the gym 3 days a week, have a gf, and when I get home I like to play PoE, and I just don't have enough time to engage in discussions here. There are a lot of great people and often times when I check a post I see someone has given an adequate reply.\n\nI have been here since closed beta, I made the bot which updates the sidebar with races and on-sale MTX, I also introduced Automoderator rules which reduce RMT related spam by 99%. I like to automate as much of our work as possible, and usually there is no need for interaction. I still reply to emails you send us, and communicate a lot with other moderators. I hope you don't misunderstand this part, I am always open to feedback, ready to discuss anything, but most of the time I have nothing to add to the discussion and I'm fine with that. [This](http://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/dzordzo) is my profile on the official forums for anyone interested.\n\nPreviously (5 months ago) I've addressed you as a community what you want from us, from this sub, how to improve, what to change and there wasn't much of a response. \nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/24cj4v/meta_monthly_subreddit_improvement_thread/\n\nSo to recap, currently active rules are in the sidebar, there is no need to black out names in screenshots, witch hunt posts are allowed all you like, just keep it civil - no death threats for example.\nIf you have a strong feeling some of our 3 new mods should not be a mod for whatever reason let us know. I would let them moderate for a while to see how they do anyway.\nIf you want someone additional on the mod team - send as a mail.\nFeel free to provide feedback regarding the colored tags either here or in a separate post.\n\nIf there is anything else let us know. We are trying hard to provide you a good service. But we are human too and we make mistakes from time to time. But I'd like to believe we are all mature adults and can solve our problems with open discussion.","retrieved_on":1426551983,"controversiality":0,"author_flair_text":"Path of Kaltenhart","link_id":"t3_2j3mks","downs":0,"distinguished":"moderator","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":"invasion","created_utc":"1413199349","subreddit":"pathofexile","score":41,"ups":41,"archived":false,"gilded":0,"score_hidden":false,"parent_id":"t3_2j3mks","id":"cl84sxx","name":"t1_cl84sxx","author":"grangelov"}

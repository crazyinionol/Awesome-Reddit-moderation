I'll make use of an example here.\n\nSay there's a new expansion out twenty minutes ago, or new patch, or even servers go down for a few minutes. We as moderators see potentially hundreds (slight hyperbole, 50+ is common though) of **repeat** posts. stuff like screen shots of place in que pop up alot and \"RIP SERVERS\" are seen by the dozen every time it happens.\n\nThat's the short term version, however, in the long term a new user can realistically find answers to their questions with a quick google/reddit search (harder) and find 5+ threads of the exact same question at different time points. \n\nHere's the hard part, all though I have not confirmed this with the others, I feel that it is safe to say that we think that threads that have already existing discussion shouldn't need to be repeated as often as it is. Trade is obviously one if not the largest discussion to be had at the current point in time, and that's good. What isn't good is that we get a new thread with a title like \"Trade sucks! What can we do to improve it?\" every few days or so. when all previous ones have 300+ comments. And **repeat** threads like these are harder to remove on a whim due to the potentially fresh perspectives the poster may provide in the comments or otherwise. \n\nHere's a word I hate \"Arbitrarily\", I hate it because saying that we have to arbitrarily do something attracts a metric fuckton of hate, excuse my french. It's true though, in this case we have to on a case by case basis decide if this \"RIP SERVERS\" or \"TRADE PROBLEMS\" should exist or not. \n\nThat might sound totalitarian too you and the answer we always receive in response is \"Why don't you let the downvotes do the job?\" And I answer, cause nobody is going to downvote a question thread! Even though the rules say that easy questions should be quarantined in the pinned questions thread. Nobody ever downvotes the pictures of \"Keeper of the trove fail/fortune!\" or the pictures of \"Tora is blind, can't she see that the entrance is right next to her?!?\". \n\nAnd most importantly, nobody will ever downvote topics they feel hold importance, even though there's been an identical post on the frontpage for three days now with hundreds of comments. \n\nThat's why we moderate, and moderation is always,always! Decision making, else we would all be replaced by automoderator. \nI doubt anyone of us are professional lawyers who can scrutinize a post and say \"Yup, this is legal!\" and \"Nope, broke the rules.\" unless of course it's obvious. \n\nI hope that brought a fresh perspective. And sorry for the tangent.

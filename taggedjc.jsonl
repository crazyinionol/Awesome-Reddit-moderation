As such, I just left the post removed since there was no point in spreading misinformation.\n\nSince then, it has been clarified that the method does work, but it was just the lack of clarity about what mod was being transferred that was causing the confusion.\n\nSo I am restoring the post and ensuring that people understand exactly what the method involves.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1577387526,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"fc3dpxn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_efsju0","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_efsju0","permalink":"\/r\/pathofexile\/comments\/efsju0\/psa_there_is_currently_a_breaking_bug_that_allows\/fc3dpxn\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1586076295,"score":1,"send_replies":false,"stickied":true,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/pathofexile","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

In an effort to help reduce clutter and facilitate discussion, we'd like to propose the idea of some weekly discussion threads. \n\nThese threads would be posted weekly by a mod and stickied, so that they remain at the top of the subreddit until the next one is posted. Depending on the preference of the community, some of these posts would be put into Reddit's \"Contest Mode\", which hides comment scores and randomizes the comment section of the thread. This would prevent newer content from being buried later on in the week, and in the case of streams, prevent streams with large followings from dominating smaller ones. Here are some of our ideas for weekly stickies. \n\n* Weekly Price Check and Trade thread\n* Weekly Unique Item Discussion\n* Weekly Keystone/Skill Discussion\n* Weekly Build thread\n* Weekly Stream Discussion\n\nSome of these may be combined into bigger threads for \u201cBuild discussion\u201d and \u201cTrade Discussion.\u201d If you have any thread ideas of your own, we would love to hear it!\n\nAs part of our efforts to facilitate discussion, we\u2019d like to see what you, as the /r/PathofExile community, would like to see in this sub. \n\n**If you like one of the Weekly threads mentioned in this post, please vote for it on [Strawpoll](http://strawpoll.me/2773792).

There was no involvement in that from Chris or anyone at GGG. I felt like having some sort of public announcement for the removal of a single post would be unnecessary, but since the question has been raised, I will answer it.  \n\nI, along with the other moderators of this subreddit, have felt for a long while that as one of the most active communities for Path of Exile that the content that ends up on the front page of the subreddit has consequences; this is why links directing people to RMT websites have been removed in the past, even in situations where it was not the original posters intent to promote that website (for example, if the OP were showing that someone had RMT'd and ought to be banned, we would still remove their post, and encourage them to submit screenshots instead, so as to not provide the website ad revenue or new users). This subreddit is an important community for those of us who play and love PoE. The last thing we want is for this community to be used as a platform for tools and websites that are harmful to the game; We gain nothing from letting cheaters use this community to gain free publicity (and as the post mentioned, donations). The Jaerin thread devolved into blatant hacks being sugar-coated and applauded in a way that felt like advertisement.   \n\nIn hindsight, the failure to include cheating and hacking programs in the rules has been an obvious oversight that needs to be fixed. The intent of the rule is to prevent the subreddit for being used to promote behaviors against the ToS.\n\nEdit: I'd also like to link to [Chris' post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/2sbn2z/why_was_the_jaerinpoehud_thread_removed/cnnz4vd) in this topic, as it might be lost due to the the parent comment being downvoted.  \n\nEdit2: I'd also like to thank impacienco for making a new discussion about the QoL topic, which was one of the good things that came out of the Jaerin thread.","gilded":0,"edited":1421212338,"parent_id":"t3_2sbn2z","retrieved_on":1424894071}

{"archived":false,"distinguished":"moderator","link_id":"t3_2uscs5","controversiality":0,"parent_id":"t1_cobbb5z","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m","body":"Hey /u/_christ_in_e I'm glad you took the time to write up your suggestions. I've written up my reactions and ideas based on your post, and would like to know what you think.\n\nYour first suggestion about using Automoderator to automatically create Loot Thursdays and Question stickies is great, and would make my life so much easier. I'm not well versed in the ways of Automod, but I'll mention this to the rest of the mod team. Loot Thread Thursdays also sound like a great way for people to share their finds. \n\nOn the other hand, I'm not so sure about limiting the subreddit to self posts. It makes browsing content unintuitive, and I believe it breaks extensions such as hoverzoom. I don't feel that the subreddit has enough of a problem with reposts or karma whores to warrant such a change.\n\nThere's a couple reasons the witch hunting rule you quoted from r/darksouls2 doesn't work for this subreddit. The first is that in PoE, you can contact players solely using their in game name, as opposed to Dark Souls, where you need a Steam name or Gamertag. The purpose of the Dark Souls rule is to prevent people from being messaged after they show up in a post. For PoE, you would need to block out *all* information, including their IGN. \n\nThe second reason is that the old mods of this subreddit *did* attempt to implement a rule that required identifying information to be blocked out. The resulting backlash caused ZiggyD, one of the most popular members of the Path of Exile community, to resign his position as moderator here. With GGG removing negative rep posts from the official forums, the PoE community has expressed the desire to have a place to talk about these things. Our current case-by-case policy on the matter is to remove baseless, defamatory accusations, and allow those that provide solid evidence.\n\nThe first rule in the subreddit is \"No Meme Posts, Image Macros or other low effort content.\" Do you feel that this is not being enforced well enough? Honest question.\n\nThe tagging is a bit pointless, we'll most likely consider removing it.\n\nThe KSP rule is good. I'd support that.\n\nThe WoW suggestion goes hand in hand with the Loot Thursdays, I like it.\n\nOther than PSA, which is very commonly used in the real world, I haven't noticed those acronyms being a problem. Also, as Titles can't be edited, our only option in enforcing this rule would be to remove the post entirely... which seems very handed for simply using an acronym. Also, this goes hand in hand with your next point mentioning Smash, but it's already hard enough to get people to read the rules without them being a page long and on a separate page. The more concise we can be while still having a good ruleset, the better.","id":"cobfsnp","author_flair_text":"Standart \u1555( \u141b )\u1557","score":8,"ups":8,"created_utc":"1423092777","score_hidden":false,"retrieved_on":1424183845,"edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":"n7","gilded":0,"subreddit":"pathofexile","downs":0,"name":"t1_cobfsnp","author":"Msmit71"}

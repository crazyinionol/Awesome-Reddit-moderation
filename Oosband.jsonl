Dev accounts can't \"spawn\" items for free, they're just normal player accounts but with added chat privileges and other extra admin options.\nIf they could spawn items then they would have fixed a few things in the past such as when the MTX amulet caused a lot of items to lose mods, like the shavs that lost it's signature es/chaos dmg mod that allows it to be used for low life. They didn't fix any of that because they couldn't.\n\nI know you may think it's a big part of the game and everyone knows about it, but 2.0 got a lot of new users to the game, and if we allow these types of threads then some of them may think it's ok to visit these sites and buy currency.

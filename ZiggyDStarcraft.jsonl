The problem is that some posts are marginalized and downvoted because they \"don't belong in the main subreddit\".\n\nAll pretty valid points, I don't think having extra subs necessarily infers that the community is divided, people can sub to as many as they want and they can find more specialised content in certain places. That said the \"don't post here, post in this empty place with cobwebs\" thing does happen, which is an issue.\n\nSo, a solution?\n\n&gt; Every game subreddit should copy the tag system /r/starcraft uses, if anyone else here is familiar with it.\n\nWould be amazing, the system is fantastic. That said their tagging system is done manually by mods... we would need a large group of mods with a lot of time and interest in the sub. Sure this sub has less content posted but that also means there are less awesome potential mods to do this. \n\n&gt; I agree with this, we can divide in the same sub anyway just put a rule for [Build-Advice/Idea/etc...] \"Thread name\" for them and maybe [Patch] \"Notes for x.x.x.x or somethign simple\n\nI think it would be awesome if people did this just to help people notice posts they are interested in. This system just relies on people titling their posts correctly though and it wouldn't be something we could really enforce without disrupting a lot of otherwise good posts. \n\n**So, what do?

I'll also clear the air as to why. \n\nI'll additionally make another thread to elect a new moderator to take my place - the mod team is already pretty snowed under. The sub will need some more hands to deal with the pretty large number of daily reports and other busy work. \n\nI've really enjoyed my past year of helping out with this sub, I think the community, overall, has been great. It's been very rewarding helping to carry out the will of this community and to have my small part in shaping it (I hope for the better). \n\nI do think that this community still has a lot to offer the larger PoE community and I'll likely still browse and comment here from time to time, though not likely close to the 1-2 hours I've spent here daily over the past year.\n\nMy reason for stepping down is that over the past few months I've been having a stronger sense [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) - there's a disconnect between some of the values of the subreddit and my own, whilst I also value upholding the wills of the community.\n\nI love the idea of reddit - a community that decides as a group how it is run and the type of content that is posted. I firmly believe that moderators are beholden to the wills of the community and I've done my utmost to moderate to what I determined to be your wills.\n\nHowever, as the gap between the values of the majority and my own widened moderating has become more and more stressful. And so that's why I'd like to pass my moderation duties onto someone else.\n\nI'm also just quite time poor these days as well! So the extra free time will be helpful for my business.\n\nI'd like to thank all of you who thanked me for my efforts over the past year, it was very motivating. And to all of you who egged me on to take the position in the first place. It's been a rewarding experience that I don't regret at all.\n\nIf you have any reasonable questions I'd be happy to answer them. Otherwise I'd encourage you to [participate in the election of a new moderator.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/2ixm82/election_of_a_new_moderator_for_rpathofexile/)\n\nI'm ZiggyD and thanks for reading.","media":null,"ups":182,"retrieved_on":1441128192,"created_utc":"1413018321","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"pathofexile","domain":"self.pathofexile","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":"moderator","title":"Within the next 24 hours I will be stepping down as moderator of /r/pathofexile","secure_media_embed":{}}

I'm making this post today to make clear the stance we [mods] take on toxic hardcore vs softcore posts.\n\nNo doubt many of you witnessed the debacle that was the response of some community members to the recent announcement of a softcore only 1 month league. Voicing desire for a hardcore option as well is good but what happened in this sub (and in other places) was disgusting. Instead of voicing a desire for choice &amp;amp; sharing feedback with the developers a lot of people simply devolved to tearing each other up about their league of choice. \n\nIt's a real shame too because I felt like over the past couple of months there was a real improvement in this whole arbitrary argument and division. And in 1 day that was all undone. I spoke to several new players that day and a few days after and suffice to say their first impressions of the PoE community and this subreddit were not positive. I'm sad to say I felt pretty ashamed and I didn't really have a good excuse to give those players.\n\nSo to make things clear us mods have been, and will continue to, remove posts that contain such toxicity. And we will ban users who post such things consistently. \n\nTo make things clear here's some examples of posts that will be removed:\n\n- fuck the softcore noobs\n\n- Alt-F4 Core\n\n- softcore sucks\n\n- scrubcore/10\n\n- standard league who gives a shit\n\n- Prbably standard fag.\n\n- Stay peons guys. And stay in your peon league\n\n- what does standard bring? nothing. its the dumpster. and people who play there thinking they are awesome -&gt; are dumpster too.\n\nAnd so on. Note the above are copy pasted comments that have been removed recently. \n\nEven if the rest of your comment or post is decent this devalues your argument and shows a real character flaw in the poster.\n\nIs this censorship of opinions? Maybe. But it's tired. It's overplayed. It's not only beating a dead horse - It's the beating the dust where a dead horse once was. It's immature. It serves no purpose. It drives no real conversation. It divides us as a community over some arbitrary standard for no reason at all. And, most importantly, it promotes an environment of toxicity.\n\nIt's time for us as a subreddit and as a community to grow out of this angsty HC vs SC bullshit.\n\nIf you have an opinion on this stance, disagree or agree, now's a great time to post it. Myself and other mods will not remove comments from this post unless they break the other sidebar rules or reddit general rules (so feel free to get it out of your system). We may or may not use this as an opportunity to harvest info about toxic posters to keep an eye on though ;)","media":null,"domain":"self.pathofexile","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1405047505","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"pathofexile","title":"[Modpost] We are Removing toxic posts &amp; comments relating to a player's preferred league &amp; banning users who repeatedly make such posts","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":"moderator","stickied":false,"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/2ae5ws/modpost_we_are_removing_toxic_posts_comments/","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m","created":1405051105,"from_kind":null,"score":607,"edited":1405167381,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_css_class":"ggg","name":"t3_2ae5ws","gilded":0,"id":"2ae5ws","archived":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":464,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"ZiggyDStarcraft"}

I've seen many of them get way out of hand in the starcraft community. [However, the community had voted](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1jpy3c/modpostdrama_witchhunt_posts_where_should_we_draw/) to allow them and as a mod I believe I'm beholden to what the majority wants the subreddit to be. (And it seems witchhunts or name and shame are desired here mainly because they are not allowed on the forums). \n\nSo the best I can do is keep them as clean as possible and keep a keen eye out for anything that crosses the somewhat arbitrary line I feel I can draw without overstepping that majority will.

{"body":"Gear posts are not currently against the rules of the sub. Rule 1 covers memes and image macros and similar content.

We do miss things and the report feature makes it a lot easier for us to find them (puts em in the mod queue).\n\nAlso, it seems the voting system is doing it's job.

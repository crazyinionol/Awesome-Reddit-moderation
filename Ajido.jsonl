By engaging with the person posting the comment, the likelihood of getting into a back and forth with them becomes pretty high. It's a lot of time wasted for no real point or gain. There are exceptions of course when I will engage, it's usually when I see the person is trying to have a civil discussion and is making effort with their comments..but they just happen to break a rule and need to be removed\/edited (By the user, we can't edit your comments).\n\nWe will happily engage with users who realize their thread\/comment was removed and discuss it then, but again it's just a waste of time and resources to notify every comment that action was taken. In addition, people get very defensive, angry, sometimes every down right nasty when a moderator does something. There's a group of people who just naturally hate any kind of authority figure and they get triggered when they feel like they're the victim of \"the man\" coming down on them.\n\n&gt; And while rule #8 seems written to cover stuff like the server going down, in practice it's also used to justify the deletion of popular (generally negative) topics\n\nWe don't censor topics, even some of the worst stories for GGG that have come out we allowed open discussion on, even when we could have come up with some BS excuse to shut it down. This place was all doom and gloom around the time Tencent was acquiring GGG, plenty of negative stuff was being posted and none of it censored. Hell, the documents people were discussing had the home addresses of Chris and other shareholders and we still allowed that stuff to stay up.\n\nRule 8 is in place because everyone feels like their thoughts and opinions are special and justify their own thread. A piece of news comes out and instead of containing it in the first\/main thread and posting a top level comment, everyone goes off starts creating their own threads.\n\n&gt; Yeah, it seems like enforcement of rule #6 is pretty arbitrary. And rule #10 is pretty loosely worded as well.\n\nThis part I agree on and it's something we discuss internally, our moderation and enforcement of 6 &amp; 10 is inconsistent at times.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1543270525,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"eaj5hrv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_a0h2my","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_eaj0w64","permalink":"\/r\/pathofexile\/comments\/a0h2my\/uhh_i_just_logged_out_to_character_screen_and_was\/eaj5hrv\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1546082276,"score":5,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/pathofexile","subreddit_type":"public"}

However, I agree it should have been removed because it was a duplicate topic as this post we're commenting in now was up an hour before yours and gaining traction.\n\nThe way moderation of subreddits work is its a group of individuals who mostly work independently of one another. We look in modqueue for reported threads\/comments and act according to a guideline. No two mods are going to approve\/remove 100% the same threads. In a perfect world it should work that way but given we're unpaid volunteers, that's never how it's going to work in any subreddit. We may interpret things differently, be missing pieces of information (Like maybe a mod doesn't notice a thread for a topic exists already and allows multiple instead of removing one and leaving the other), etc.\n\nThis is why things like modmail exist, we recognize we're not perfect and going to make mistakes. So if\/when a mistake happens you can message modmail and that is seen by all mods, so we can review and make revisions if necessary. Just to give you a sense of what things are like behind the scenes. On more controversial\/hot topics, we do get together on Discord and have discussions how something should be handled.

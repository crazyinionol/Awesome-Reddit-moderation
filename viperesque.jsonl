{"author":"viperesque","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"Please read the following [clarification from Mark](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/6r8xfg/here_is_the_skill_gem_information_for_the_new/dl3cxf3/) about the balance and description for this skill:\n\n&gt;A quick update on the issues with this post:\n\n&gt;The inital reveal of this gem had an incorrect stat description, and non-final balance values. Bex has posted a version with the up-to-date stat description below. We'll also try to update with the latest balance values as soon as we can.\n\n&gt;Both of these issues are my fault. Yesterday, while writing the final versions of the stat descriptions for this gem, one of my changes didn't make it through, and I didn't double-check this before telling Bex the final stat descriptions were done.\n\n&gt;In addition, while writing the descriptions, I did a final check on the skill, and found a substantial bug with how the conditional damage modifier was implemented - it wasn't doing what it said it was. I fixed this, and discussed with Rory the extent to which this threw off the balance testing that had been done on the skill so far (answer: significantly). He determined the gem would need to be rebalanced in light of the fact the damage modifier would now work correctly, when it hadn't been during testing. (I also found it dealt weapon damage when hitting chests - this was also fixed, but has no balance implimcations outside of situations where a chest could have evaded the hit).\n\n&gt;I had assumed that change was made yesterday and thus would be reflected in the current values of the gem available to Bex today - I was incorrect. This rebalance is a trickier issue than I'd thought, and is still ongoing.\n\n&gt;I apologise for the confusion and panic caused by these problems with the preview - the fault for both lies with me, not Bex. I can't give an ETA on the balance changes being finalised, but we'll try to get them up here once they are. While we're all very busy trying to make sure the actual launch goes well, and that still has to take priority, we'll try to prevent any such slip ups with anything else that's revelealed before the launch.\n","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1501729429,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dl3dcpx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_6r8xfg","parent_id":"t3_6r8xfg","retrieved_on":1503720780,"score":1,"stickied":true,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m"}

More detail would be good.\n\nThat said, let me explain why this is our policy. But first off, there are definitely issues with trying to hold a discussion in a huge thread. That's very fair, and an intrinsic problem with reddit's setup \u2014 new replies are buried. Something we could easily do is set the default comment sort to new. Would that help?\n\nSo, let's suppose you don't want your comment to get buried and you start a new thread about it instead. Fair enough. Let's then suppose that the next person going to comment feels the same way and does the same thing. In fact, what if every potential commenter on the thread did that? Suddenly we'd have dozens or hundreds of new threads about it. That's clearly bad.\n\nObviously this is an extreme example that doesn't happen. But a lot of people do post. We've removed over a hundred threads about the Tencent buyout already. We don't want that to dominate the subreddit, simply because most people aren't interested. The question then becomes \"Where do you draw the line?\" At what point do you start deleting threads? What percentage of them do you delete? What criteria do you follow? I don't think there's a good answer to that question that avoids bias or negative externalities.\n\nIronically (or maybe intentionally), this thread is an example of the sort of thing we want to avoid \u2014 discussions cascading into new threads.

Path of Exile is an action RPG developed by New Zealand-based Grinding Gear Games. A spiritual successor to Diablo II, Path of Exile's headlining features include insane amounts of character customisation, an enormous endgame, high replayability value, and deep lore steeped in blood and corruption. This announcement is for the newest of the game's many expansions, which are released for free every 3 months.\n\nIf you're interested in giving Path of Exile a try, you can download and play for free at https:\/\/www.pathofexile.com\/. Path of Exile's free to play model is based around convenience and cosmetic features, meaning that you don't have to pay a cent to experience everything the game has to offer and cannot pay for in-game power. New player tips and resources can be found [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pathofexile\/comments\/9ty40h\/new_player_tips_and_qa\/).

At the very least, asking users to be able to predict our intent is unfair. If we tweak the rules to specifically prevent the sort of behaviour that Aggnog engages in, then in all likelihood he will acknowledge that new boundary and start pushing on it instead.

This is necessarily and unavoidably biased by our own leanings and political beliefs.\n\n* Even in the longer term, it's incredibly difficult to gauge the will of the community on topics like this. Any attempt to solicit opinions on how we should handle threads like these is wide open to manipulation.\n\n* Any action we take can be interpreted as political if someone wishes, even if we have no intention of it being so. To take an obvious example, it's very very easy for people to claim that us removing a thread about politics is an attempt at censorship for political purposes, regardless of our motivation. It's also possible (and I believe credible) to make the argument that our motivations don't even matter, and that every action is political regardless. If you use that frame of reference then we're pretty much screwed, as our goal of not taking sides becomes explicitly impossible.\n\n* None of us are more politically literate than you'd expect any educated person to be. And frankly, I don't think we should be expected to be because this is a video game subreddit. It does mean that we're not necessarily in our comfort zones when handling this sort of thing though.\n\nBasically, we think we're doing our best but it's never going to be perfect, and when topics like this come up whatever course of action we decide upon is guaranteed to piss off a lot of people.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1570579450,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f31mvbt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_df5zx7","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_f31lza5","permalink":"\/r\/pathofexile\/comments\/df5zx7\/anyone_else_suddenly_worried_about_ggg_censoring\/f31mvbt\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1578631818,"score":53,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/pathofexile","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

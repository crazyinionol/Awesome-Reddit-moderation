Greetings, little Exiles! Gather 'round as we dive into the whimsical world of rules and hilarity, where the motto is: **“Rules for thee, not for me!”**

Welcome to the Rule Zone
You’ve entered a realm where *fun* takes a backseat to *order.* Here, you’re not just players; you’re delightful subjects of our intricate ruling system.

Who Wields the Power?
Ah, the puppet masters! A self-appointed, self-perpetuating, "mysterious" collective that emerges from the shadows like the ultimate band of pranksters. Think of it as an anonymous cabal, whispering sweetly in your ear while spinning webs of gaslighting. It's like a comedy show—except you're the only ones not laughing!

The Real Agenda
What's their grand plan, you ask? To keep the RMT mafia (Romantic Misadventures of Trading) thriving! Yes, The Forbidden Trove and its mischievous cousins are the real stars of this show. They’re like the cool kids in high school—while you’re stuck at lunch before detention!

Your New Motto
“Stop complaining and start complying!” It’s a little catchy, don’t you think? Say it with me! It’s a reminder that your grievances are simply exquisite melodies in the symphony of our rule!

{"author":"Shaeltal","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"body":"&gt; Would unintentionally asking questions that dumb also warrant a ban or is it the ban dependent purely on my motives (of which they were unaware or told of subsequently), as I feel like that is a dangerous precedent to set on a (largely) anonymously played online video game.  \n\n No, it would not. The ban is a combination of a few factors. First, as illustrated in the clip, you state,\"You know what, we're going into the public reddit and make fun of people for being dumb. Let's go to the reddit discord\". Clearly, you are joining the Discord with the intent of demeaning active voice users through targeted questions and manipulative responses to extract the kinds of responses to illustrate your point that 1) Path of Exile redditors are inferior 2) GGG should not be taking feedback from reddit, and as such 3) \"The next time anyone on fucking reddit questions me, here you go: 'suck the fattest of cocks'\". This clearly breaks the very first rule of the Discord as listed in the #rules-and-info channel: \"Be respectful! ; Personal abuse, obscene, harassing, threatening, hateful, discriminatory or defamatory remarks of any nature won't be tolerated\". Your behavior as exemplified in the clip is anything but respectful.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSecond: Regarding the issue of setting a dangerous precedent - While I have not discussed this issue with the other moderators, I was not solely responsible for the ban. I brought the issue to light with other moderators and they were in agreement with banning you. Any person found to be breaking the rules of the discord are dealt with, so explicit trolling and rule infractions are the exception, not the norm. The fact that the clip illustrates your lack of respect and makes it an explicit breach of the rules is exacerbated by the fact that you broadcasted the entire episode to others, promoting such behavior. As a streamer with an audience, your actions can and will be mimicked, and failure to deal with the source only encourages others to copy that behavior.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThirdly, you state that, \"I have no expectation of you to recant this decision, however would also like to say that if you do I will continue to do this, as I do not see this as being a remotely punishable offence\". Why would a ban be lifted if you openly admit to us that you will continue trolling the Discord? Even your own twitch chat remarks how rude you are during the clip. We don't need to double dip on the moderating activity.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFinally, concerning the moderation of misinformation on the voice comm. This issue isn't easily remedied as moderating mistakes in knowledge would essentially be stifling free speech. Now, if you had corrected those \"misguided and idiotic sentiments\" in the voice chat, perhaps we could all enjoy more informed discussions and continue enjoying Path of Exile on a deeper level. Although not everyone will listen to you or understand the knowledge that you are trying to convey, some will grasp the information and hopefully do the same for others, promoting the growth of a healthy community.","can_gild":true,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1495430692,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dhvjcjz","link_id":"t3_6cksqb","parent_id":"t1_dhvhb0j","retrieved_on":1496722890,"score":18,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m"}

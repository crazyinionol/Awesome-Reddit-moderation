We added post flairs because users wanted to filter those posts out (and other ones, for example you can filter any specific streamer with RES now). No one wants to filter out 'default', but the majority of users who asked for filters wanted to filter out fluff. \n\nUnfortunately, most users don't flair their post (despite getting a PM each time they post about it), so many fluff posts go unflaired and accumulate reports/complaints and waste our time dealing with reports/modmail/comment arguments about it. If the default is fluff, that complaint quantity decreases. Also, because most of the filters are for fluff, there's hopefully a slight upvote discouragement to not flairing your post, although I wouldn't count on it.\n\nWhat I'd like to do is remove posts that aren't flaired, until they are flaired, so that everything is labeled properly, but that'd likely cause an uproar, and we might need a custom bot to do that.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1500755748,"distinguished":"moderator","edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"dkkw7nh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_6ow64t","parent_id":"t3_6ow64t","retrieved_on":1501476925,"score":45,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"pathofexile","subreddit_id":"t5_2sf6m"}

Not everyone agrees with this, in fact, it was one of the core reasons ZiggyD left the mod team iirc (there's a post by him on the subreddit somewhere).  However, the way the current group of mods operate is to poll the community when there's a dispute, and make\/keep rules based on that. We do at least one of those polls every year.  \n\nWhy not a separate subreddit? The community didn't vote for it. I'm not sure if it was ever in a specific poll, but we added each frequently suggested option to our polls \/ public discussion, and it didn't receive enough support to be included in one. [If you think this would be a good idea, make a discussion thread on it, and if it gets enough support, I'll make sure to include it later this year when we do another rules refresh]\n\nI could tell you my personal opinion on scamming, what's banworthy, if these threads are effective, etc, but it doesn't really matter because we only enforce the rules, we don't dictate them ourselves.

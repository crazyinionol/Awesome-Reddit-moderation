But I discussed this with the other moderators, we've decided self-promotion is not something we want in this subreddit coming up with the new changes of rules coming up (which we will revise and talk with the community before implementing). Sorry your post has to be one of the first to be caught in this. We are NOT trying to stamp out the little streamers, do not be discouraged. But please understand that we're changing things here for the better in order to reduce clutter. \n\nMany posts including links to streams,price checks and other cool finds will now be posted in weekly threads similar to Weekly Discussions this subreddit used to have a year or so ago. If you have any complaints please direct them to me, I was the one that removed your post but I did consult the other mods about this decision as we were all wondering whether or not links such as this should be allowed.
